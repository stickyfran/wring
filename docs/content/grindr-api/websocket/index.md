# WebSocket

WebSocket URL:

```
wss://grindr.mobi/v1/ws
```

Only [Authorization](/grindr-api/api-authorization) and [User-Agent](/grindr-api/security-headers#user-agent) are required in the connection request. Expired authorization tokens do not cause the connection to be closed, although attempting to use such an expired token with a [command](/grindr-api/websocket/commands) will result in it being closed by the server with status code 4401.

Upon successful connection, a [`ws.connection.established`](/grindr-api/websocket/events#ws-connection-established) event is received by the client.
